# Clock-API
Made to help you with timezones, time, date, and day! Use it in your projects!


Made by Vihaan Sauhta.
Please give credit if you use this.
You'll help a small programmer!

Also everything is in index.html via <script> and <style> tags,
no additional CSS or JS files.

You can add the WHOLE API with this code in your project:
```HTML
<iframe
  src="https://vihaangithub.github.io/Clock-API/"
  width="100%"
  height="1000"
  style="border: none;">
</iframe>
```
Hope you like this API!
